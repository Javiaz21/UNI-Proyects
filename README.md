# This is a repository for my UNI projects.
Focusing on my End of Career project.

Scripts in this repository revolve around the topics of Machine learning and computer vision, applied in python and some with the addition of Arduino integration.

DISCLAIMER, this is not a functional repository, just a dump of some of the scripts I've worked on.
