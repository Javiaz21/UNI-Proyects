# This is a repository for my UNI projects.
Focusing on my End of Career project.

Scripts in this repository revolve around the topics of Machine learning and computer vision, applied in python and some with the addition of Arduino integration.

-Main branch: some of the files used in the development of a self driving vehicle controled by Machine learning integrating SLAM.

-Proyect 2 branch: Image processing using fourier filters, useful for detecting visual discrepancies in a picture of an object.

DISCLAIMER, this is not a functional repository, just a dump of some of the scripts I've worked on.
